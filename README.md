# Authorship-Attribution-using-SVM
In this work I developed four SVM based models to do the authorship attribution task, each using different features.  
1. Using function word occurrences.  
2. Using unigram and bigram occurrences.  
3. Using tfidf.  
4. Using custom features (numbe of unique words, sentence length distribution, word length distribution, number of pronouns per sentence and number of conjunctions per sentence)  
The TfIdf model outperforms other models.  
Dataset are plain texts downloaded from Gutenberg project.
